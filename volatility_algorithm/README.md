-This project was developed as an exploration into the functionality of the Alpaca API, focusing on the implementation of key features and data retrieval processes. The core concept behind this algorithm was based on the idea that large institutions such as banks or hedge funds might sell assets due to liquidity concerns, causing temporary price declines despite the underlying value of the stock remaining unchanged. The goal was to capitalize on these price corrections by entering trades during the rebound phase. However, this strategy is inherently risky as there is potential for prices to continue falling due to broader market conditions or negative news, which can alter the fundamental value of the asset.

-The algorithm is designed to pull real-time stock prices at two-second intervals, comparing the most recent price with the price recorded a specified number of minutes ago. If the price deviation exceeds a predefined threshold, the algorithm triggers a trade with both a stop loss and a take profit order, assuming that the stock will recover.

-While the strategy served as a useful learning tool, it is not viable in practice. In volatile or declining markets, prices can continue to fall without rebounding, resulting in repeated losses. A more robust version would require logic to pause or adjust trading after multiple consecutive stop-losses. On top of this, the program was developed in Python, which is not well-suited for high-frequency trading due to its relatively slow execution speed. In a competitive trading environment, any brief opportunities would likely be captured by faster systems, often built in lower-level languages like C++ and run with direct exchange access. Additionally, The data retrieved through the API also introduces latency, as it cannot match the speed and efficiency of direct exchange access used by most high-frequency trading firms.
