-This algorithm was developed as an early attempt to incorporate more mathematical and statistical concepts into trading strategies. It was also the first project in which I successfully retrieved and utilized historical pricing data through the Alpaca API.

-The strategy is based on the principle of mean reversion, the idea that asset prices tend to return to their historical average over time. The algorithm compares a list of individual stocks to a corresponding ETF that includes those stocks. The rationale is that if the overall market (as represented by the ETF) experiences a sharp decline, the constituent stocks will likely drop as well. If there's no fundamental change in value, these stocks are expected to revert to their mean prices.

-To help filter out stock-specific risk, the algorithm only triggers trades when both the individual stock and the broader market (ETF) show significant deviation. This reduces the chance of entering a position in a stock that has declined due to company-specific news rather than a broader market movement. The strategy works by calculating the ETFâ€™s mean and standard deviation over a defined historical period. It then computes a z-score using the ETF's current price. If the z-score is less than -1 (indicating the ETF is significantly below its mean), the algorithm retrieves both current and historical prices for the target stocks. It then places limit buy orders at one standard deviation below the latest price of each stock, assuming a rebound toward the mean.

-This strategy has not been thoroughly tested and makes a key assumption that when the overall market declines, the underlying value of individual stocks remains unchanged. In practice, this is not always the case. Broad market sell-offs often reflect legitimate concerns such as deteriorating economic conditions, shifts in investor sentiment, or global events that can affect the intrinsic value of the stocks themselves. As a result, prices may not revert to their historical mean as expected. For this strategy to be more robust, additional filters or signals would be needed to distinguish between temporary dislocations and fundamental shifts in value.
