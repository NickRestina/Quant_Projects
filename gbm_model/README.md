-Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is a stochastic model used to simulate the random movement of asset prices over time. It relies on a stochastic differential equation, also utilized in the Black-Scholes model for pricing financial derivatives. This project serves as an introduction to advanced mathematical modeling techniques for forecasting asset prices. GBM is driven by two key components: drift and volatility. The drift rate represents the expected return of an asset over time, while volatility reflects the magnitude of its price fluctuations. To account for market randomness, the model incorporates a normally distributed random variable, which is recalculated at each step of the simulation to introduce variability in the asset’s path. The forecast is performed over a defined number of days, divided into discrete time intervals. At each interval, the asset's price is updated using its previous value, combined with the drift, volatility, and a new random variable. This iterative process generates a single potential price trajectory. To assess a range of possible future outcomes, the simulation is run multiple times using different random inputs. This technique, known as a Monte Carlo simulation, produces a distribution of potential asset price paths, offering insight into future value scenarios and risk profiles. This project helped build a foundational understanding of stochastic processes in finance and provided a stepping stone toward more complex models and simulations.

-For each stock, the program uses the Alpaca API to retrieve historical price data, which is then used to calculate the drift rate and volatility. To maintain relevance, the time frame of the historical data is selected to closely match the forecast duration. Using data from too long ago can result in volatility estimates that no longer reflect current market conditions. The drift rate is determined by calculating the average of the asset’s logarithmic returns, while volatility is computed as the standard deviation of those returns. The forecast period is divided into a specified number of discrete steps, and these inputs are fed into the GBM formula. The model then runs a large number of simulations each generating a potential price path for the stock.

-This project was split into two separate programs to serve distinct purposes:

  1. S&P 500 Automated Trading Tool- This script performs Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) simulations across the entire S&P 500. It computes the average ending price from all simulated paths for each stock, ranks them, and generates a list of
     the top and bottom 20 forecasted performers. The top 20 stocks are then used to place limit buy orders through the Alpaca API.
     
     Limitations:
     A key drawback of this approach is that averaging the simulated price paths tends to reflect each stock’s historical drift, making the results heavily dependent on past performance. As a result, the strategy just trades based off past
     performance. Backtesting has shown that this algorithm performs reasonably well under certain market conditions. However, because the model assumes constant drift and volatility, its accuracy diminishes in more dynamic environments. To
     improve its realism and predictive power, future versions of this program could incorporate a volatility forecasting component to account for changing market conditions. Additionally, machine learning techniques could be implemented to
     dynamically adjust model parameters by comparing predicted prices to actual outcomes, allowing the model to learn and improve over time.
     
  3. GBM Visualizer– This program is a modified version of the original Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model designed to visualize potential price paths of a selected stock. It was modified for use in COINS' copper trades by estimating trade
     limits by simulating various future scenarios, making it easier to evaluate risk and opportunity within short-term trading windows.
